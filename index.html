        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Hello there!</strong> My name is Aurelie, a junior developer with a growing passion for crafting digital experiences and solving real-world challenges through code. My journey into the world of technology began with an intensive bootcamp, where I immersed myself in the realms of JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS. The exhilarating process of turning lines of code into functional, user-friendly interfaces ignited my fascination for the possibilities of the digital landscape.        </p>

        <p>
          After the bootcamp, I dove into a year of hands-on experience as a junior developer, collaborating on projects that harnessed the power of Python, Flask, and mySQL. This journey has equipped me with not only technical expertise but also a deep appreciation for the intricacies of software development.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond the realm of coding, I find joy in the art of creation ‚Äì both in lines of code and in the kitchen. You'll often find me researching about the pastry arts, learning about the different methods of lamination or the proper technique for folding french macaron batter. When I'm not baking, I'm likely immersing myself in a good movie or trying to find a comfortable position to binge read a novel until the birds start chirping.
        </p>

        <p>
          What truly excites me about this dynamic field is the continuous learning journey it offers. Every challenge is an opportunity to learn, adapt, and improve. As I embark on this path as a junior developer, my goal is to contribute my skills to meaningful projects and do my best to uplift other marginalized women in the tech industry while growing as a developer. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm excited to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts, creators, and potential collaborators, and be able to learn new things from each and every divers perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cheers to coding, creativity, and the journey ahead!
        </p>
